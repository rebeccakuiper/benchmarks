\usage{
benchmarks(
  goric_obj,
  pop.est = NULL,
  N = NULL,
  other.N = NULL,
  iter = 1000,
  seed.value = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{goric_obj}{An object from the goric function from the restriktor package. In this function, the GORIC or GORICA can be applied to every type of statistical model.}

\item{pop.est}{Optional. A nr.es-times-k matrix of population values for the k parameters of interest, leading to nr.es sets of population values. By default, pop.est = NULL; then, the estimates from the sample will be used. Benchmarks will be calculated for each of these value(s).}

\item{N}{Needed (and only used) if goric object is based on estimates and their covariance matrix (instead of on a model / fit object) and other.N is not NULL. A k-times-1 vector or a scalar to denote the (total) sample sizes. By default, N = NULL.}

\item{other.N}{Optional (which only works if the goric object is based on a fit object and not on estimates and their covariance matrix). A scalar to denote the (total) sample sizes, if you like to use another than used in the data. You could use this, for instance, to see to which values the GORIC(A) weights will converge (and thus to see the maximum value of the weights). By default, other.N = NULL. In that case, the sample size from the data will be used.}

\item{iter}{Optional. A scalar denoting the number of iterations used to determine the benchmarks weights. By default, iter = 1000. Notable, the higher iter, the longer the computation time.}

\item{seed.value.}{Optional. A scalar denoting the seed value. By default, seed.value = 123. By changing this value, you can inspect the sensitivity of the benchmarks -- which should not be present; if it is, you should increase the value of iter.}
}
\value{
The output comprises case-specific benchmarks for the GORIC(A) weight and ratio of weights of the preferred hypothesis (for each of the specified population estimates), based on the 5\\%, 35\\%, 50\\%, 65\\%, and 95\\% percentiles (using the sample size from the data).
}
\description{
This function calculates case-specific benchmarks for the GORIC(A) weight and ratio of weights of the preferred hypothesis, assuming user-specified population parameter estimates.
